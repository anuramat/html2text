Team,

WeÂ move to test ne release now. ðŸ˜€ In our first test phase, we do not alter our
tests, but use the same tests against old. Â Our objective of this phase is to
find new issues with OLD tests. Â You can see our progress from http://bla/
summary04152020.html.


The following table in the report shows our bug progress. Â You can see more
